				<h2>Introduction : </h2>
				<p>Participants in the event will be subjected to a challenge to make a sand filter that can clean translucent water to make it look transparent with naked eyes. Such a sand filter must filter water at fastest rate to be itself best of the rest.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="e_text">
				<h2>Eligibility : </h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Open for all</li>
					<li>If the number of participants registered are more than 8 then a paper test will be conducted to select the best eight. The test shall examine the following </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="e_text">
				<h2>Specifications : </h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Participants will be provided with a utensil/jar of about 100 sqcm in area and 60 cm in height. The bottom base of the utensil will be permeable with several holes of diameter 2mm (approx.) this size will be able to retain flaky particle of 4.75mm: (as 4.75 X 5/9 > 2mm) </li>
					<li>They will also be given the following type of soil particle size sample: <ul>
						<li>75micron</li>
						<li>150micron</li>
						<li>300micron</li>
						<li>600micron</li>
						<li>1.18mm</li>
						<li>2.36mm</li>
						<li>4.75mm</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The translucent water that will be used for testing will contain non- toxic and inorganic impurities suspended in it. Impurities will be passing from 75 micron sieve (i.e. will be smaller in size than 75 micron). </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="e_text">
				<h2>Procedure :</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Participants will get the jar and 1.5 kg of every sample as specified above.  </li>
					<li>They will have to make their soil filter in 2 hour. Participants can test their filter within this given time, as they can get the above specified translucent water as many times as they want.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="e_text">
				<h2>Judging Criteria :</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Transparency test: The translucent water passed through the filter should be transparent(i.e. could be seen through the naked eyes) </li>
					<li>Efficiency test: If the first criterion is satisfied then 100ml of translucent water will be poured in the filter (initially with no water). The filter passing 80ml of water in fastest time will be termed as most efficient and will win. 
					</li>
					<li>NO INITIAL WATER CONDITION: A filter will be termed as a filter with no initial water if not more than a drop in 5 seconds shall come out of it when left undisturbed.</li>
				</ul>
