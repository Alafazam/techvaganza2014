			<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
			<p>Portray a sky rise building under construction and the first things to strike you are the gigantic tower cranes. First used in the early 1960's, these engineering marvels have played an integral role in shaping the modern civilization. But in most places we see normal cranes using motorized elevating mechanisms. But we can also use the enormous power of Hydraulics in working of these cranes. Here is a chance to create your very own hydraulic tower crane.</p>
