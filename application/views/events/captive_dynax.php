			<h2>Event Description</h2>
			<p>Who is not aware about the miserable condition of Kashmir in winters?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>No electricity!</li>
				<li>Snowfall all the time, it becomes hard to distinguish between day and night. </li>
				<li>Conventional solutions or alternatives which need a drastic improvement.</li>
				<li>'Life' ceases to exist as we sit sit huddled in a corner near the fireplace </li>
			</ul>

			<p>Even in the home with no light and increasing cold, the house loses energy in many forms.
			The only solution is to preserve or capture this escaping energy rather than looking for more energy resources. Thus the questions this engineering problem leaves us with are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to improve overall thermal performance of a room, </li>
				<li>Making it more comfortable in terms of heat resisting with respect to economical available resources and consequently less energy dependent.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Engineering Problem:</h3>
			<h4>In our local climate (Kashmir),</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>What building materials? </li>
				<li>What design of living home? </li>
				<li>What auxiliary source of heating (for less heat depletion in terms of radiation, conduction, convection)? </li>
				<li>What structure of building soothing all requirements available at hilly areas? </li>
				<li>Extensive use of adhesive technology to make the right composite, i.e. finding right composition of chemical compounds to make the required binding agent.  </li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<h4>Should be used so that</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>It does not release heat quickly once the sun sets e.g. steel roof cools off quickly whereas tiled roof continues to radiate heat. </li>
				<li>It keeps the heat during the day e.g. appropriate colour choice. </li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p>Outline the problem of heat transfer and how it can be minimized by choosing the right building materials and installing insulation in Townsville. </p>

			<h2>Rounds and their description:</h2>
			
			<h3>Round I:</h3>
			<p>Introductory Session comprising with all the guidelines required to delve the participants deep into the correct problem leading to feasible & economically viable solutions
			This Introductory Session will be mentored by some experts from relevant fields.
			After the Session, a short quiz is to be organised taking the basis of the Introductory Session (Workshop) to judge the aptitude towards the Problem in the coming rounds:
			Technical Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) round (Brief subjective questions can be asked.) This MCQ part can be summarised as: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Maximum of two members per team. </li>
				<li>Each team has to solve 30 multiple choice questions. </li>
				<li>Each team will be given 20 minutes to answer the questions.  </li>
				<li>Marks will be deducted for wrong answers. </li>
				<li>Top scorers will qualify for the next round. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Result would be announced on the spot within a time span (gap) of 30 min.
			</p>
			<h3>Round II:</h3>
			<h4>We'll provide teams some</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>cardboard sheets </li>
				<li>other heat resisting material (to be decided later on as per the availability) so that they can make prototype on the basis of certain requirements of a house (no. & sizes of the rooms, kitchen, bathrooms, etc would be told on the spot as per the availability of the time) and demonstrate the whole designing and the material used to judges. </li>
