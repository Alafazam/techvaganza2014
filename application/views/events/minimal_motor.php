				<h2>Introduction : </h2>
				<p>Minimal motor is a motor prepared from very basic
					and limited inventory.The design of this running
					mechanical deviced from otherwise basic objects needs
					innovative and out of the box thinking.It also teaches us
					the value of recyling or creative use of our trash.

				<h2>Idea : </h2>
				<p>
					Electric motor is a device that converts electrical energy
					(from a battery or voltage source) into mechanical energy
					(used to cause rotation).When a current carrying conductor
					is placed in a magnetic field,the conductor experiences a
					force which rotates the motor.Commutation is to be taken
					care of for successful operation of DC motor.

				<h2>Event Format : </h2>
				<ul>
					<li>There will be two rounds in this event .</li>
					<li>There is no limit to the number of teams that can participate in the first round.There will be three members in each team.</li>
					<li>Round 1 will be MCQ quiz.The questions in this quiz will check the participants electrical engineering concepts. Only Six teams will be selected for the next round.</li>
					<li>Round 2 is the main round of this event in which the participants have to perform the tests .Winner will bedecided on the cumulative score of each team from the two rounds.</li>
					<li>In case of tie, the winner would be decided by an oral quiz.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Task : </h2>
				<ul>
					<li>There is a set of basic household inventory that each team would be provided.</li>
					<li>The teams have to use these materials and design a DC motor.</li>
					<li>The DC motor should be robust and firm.It should be able to	run even if the shaft is lighlty loaded.Also,self start motors would be given more points</li>
					<li>The main judging criteria would be speed of the motor.</li>
					<li>Further, the teams can earn extra points by returing the unused objects from their set of materials.</li>
					<li>Thus,teams should try to make the motor by using least possible objects.</li>
