				<h2>Objective : </h2>
				<p>As this event is based on the estimation skills and observation power which is the basic need in civil engineering, it judges the estimating ability of the participants for better accuracy and precision. 
				The final round will judge the accuracy and speed of the engineers in various fields like traffic engineering and logistics while testing their mental strength and sharpness in different situations.</p> 
				<p>“The charm of ‘CIVIL’ization depends on your estimate.” </p><br>
				<p>This event provides you with a platform to show how good an estimator you are.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>MEASURE, ESTIMATE AND WIN PRIZES.</li>
					<li>NO REGISTRATION FEES.</li>

				<h2>Round Details : </h2>
				<p>Round-1 : prelims</p><br>
				<ul>
					<li>30 basic civil engineering objective type questions will be given to the participants for solution. </li>
				</ul><br>
				<p>Round-2 : Measure'Em</p><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Objects that are used in basic civil engineering work or in our day to day life will be given to the participating teams.</li>
					<li>The participants have to measure the dimension of the objects and will have to draw the necessary views such as plan and elevation on a paper along with the dimension.</li>
					<li>The teams will not be provided with any type of measuring aids.</li>
					<li>Points will be awarded according to their accuracy and precision.</li>
					<li>The cumulative points of round 1 and round 2 will be calculated. The top teams will qualify for the third round.</li>
				</ul><br>
				<p>Round-3 </p><p>This round consists of two stages : </p><br>
				<p>Stage-1 : Estimate'Em</p>
				<ul><li>They will be given various paths with different traffic conditions for which they have to estimate the most suitable path.</li></ul>
				<p>Stage-2 : Fix'Em</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This round is slightly tougher than other rounds. </li>
					<li>A problematic situation will be presented before the qualifiers.</li>
					<li>They will have to give the most convenient solution for that problem.</li>
				</ul>
