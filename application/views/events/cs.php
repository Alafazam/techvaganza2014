				<h2>Introduction : </h2>
				<p>Counter Strike 1.6 is a fast-paced shooting game pitting some of the world's top elite forces against terrorists. The game is oriented mainly toward multi-play and has a training mode where the user can become familiar with the features of the game. Though Counter Strike is categorized as an FPS game, the main distinction of this game is that team play and working as a team is the key factor to success rather than just pure individual ability. This game offers a strong, almost unsettling, sense of realism, which makes it that much more exciting to play and watch.
