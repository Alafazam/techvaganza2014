                                <p>According to the environmentalists, bears are one of the most innocent of the wild, but ironically, there is a common belief among the people that they are one of the most furious of the beasts.</p>
                                <p>This valley has been home to the black bears since ages but in the past few decades there has been a perturbing decline in their population because of increasing human population. At the same time, there have also been several cases where humans have been intensely harmed by the bears, though for defense. These increasing conflicts are detrimental for the bears as well as humans.</p>
                                <p>We can never be successful technocrats without feeling the essence of nature. Through this initiative, we intend to resolve these conflicts using innovative ideas and technology suited to both.</p>
